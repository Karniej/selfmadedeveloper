# Extensions

>*As many of you that follow me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/selfmadedeveloper/) know. I use Visual Studio Code when working with code. I had some question about some extensions that I could recommend so here's a list of extensions that I use every day.*

## 1. React Native Snippet

This is the most used **extension** by me. If you're working on the new App when you are building new **components** all the time you probably feel that writing all the code necessary for the whole component takes a long time to write.

Why not use a snippet and write 3 letters and the whole code will be written. This Extension does a great job in doing that and many more snippets like **importing**, **style** helpers, etc...

Learn a few snippets and your life will be much **easier** and you'll become even more **productive**!

*Recommendation scale:*  **5/5**

## 2. JavaScript console utils

As a JavaScript developer, you use **console.log** everyday and this extension help you work with your console logs. I spoke about this extension with a few friend developers and they always thanked to me, because it also speeds up your workflow.

Use Cmd+Shift+D and delete all the console.log occurrences in the file you're in. Instead of writing the name of the variable and putting in the console.log, simply **highlight the variable and use Cmd+Shift+L and the extension will write the **console.log for you. 

*Recommendation scale:* **5/5**

## 3. React PropTypes Intellisense

This particular one is a great one when your Component has a long list of props and you don't remember all the names. Write part of the name of a props and the extension **suggest the name you want.** Speed up your **productivity** even more! 

*Recommendation scale:* **4/5**

## 4. React Native Tools

This extension does the language support for React Native. Code-hinting and integrated commands for **React Native framework. This is a **must have if you'd like to use Visual Studio Code with React Native

*Recommendation scale:* **5/5**

## 5. Bracket Pair Colorizer

When I first downloaded the extension I hated it and immediately deleted it, after some time I gave it one more try and found out in a half hour how useful it may be! This extension **colorize pair of **brackets whether is in **function, **object or **array scope. 

It's not necessary, but I also recommended it to a few dev friends and they found it helpful many times. 

*Recommendation scale:* **4/5**

## **Summary**

There are even more useful extensions I use, but those particular one I find very useful and helpful in my **everyday** job as a React Native Developer.

I will definitely write a second part of this post in the future where I'll describe more broadly used extensions.

See you next time!
