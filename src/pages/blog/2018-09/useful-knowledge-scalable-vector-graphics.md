# SVG

The most important thing to get you in front of the doors to your first job I described in this series [programming-learn-it-by-yourself](https://selfmadedev.com/blog/2018-07/programming-learn-it-by-yourself-part-1/) , but that isn't where it ends. There are tons of other stuff to learn and as I learned on the job, there are more **often** used for Web and Mobile developers than I thought.

One of this things is **SVG** format. As a Web or Mobile developer, you'll encounter using SVG on the daily basis and it's getting more and more **popular** every day.

**SVG** stands for Scalable Vector Graphics and itÂ defines **vector-based** graphics in **XML** format.

## **What SVG helps with ?**

- **Animating** different elements of every possible **shapes** can bring a lot of life and pleasant feel to the app.
- Many elements with **unconventional** shapes can be only made with **SVG** files.
- Awesome **Graphs** and **Charts**.
- Beautiful elements **transitions** while navigation, **onboardings**, **splash** **screens** and many many more.

I am not an expert in this area, but numerous beautiful things are being made with manipulation of **SVG** by JavaScript.
I haven't seen it anywhere in the job offerings, but if is most of the times required and you find out about it during the job, so it's good to know that you could learn it **before**.

In React Native, there's a little bit limited **API** for SVG compared to the Web, but still **ton** of stuff can be made and there's a lots to learn i this area.

[This is](https://www.udemy.com/learn-svg-animation/learn/v4/overview) one course on **Udemy** I took long time ago when I was trying to learn **SVG** animation a while ago, while I haven't been even thinking about learning React Native. I somehow got it for free, but now it's quite cheap and it was pretty good, so I recommend **taking** this one. If you know any better course around SVG, let me know!

I encountered many problems with **SVG** in my job for the last 2 weeks, that I feel like I need to refresh my knowledge on this and I'll definitely will have to and do this course again.

This is it for today. Learn **SVG** as soon as you grasp the basics, it's a quite broad subject and will probably take some time to master so better **start today**!
