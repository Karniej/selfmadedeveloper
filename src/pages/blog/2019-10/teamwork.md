It’s Friday and which is a good day to talk about teamwork.
I’m a **frontend developer**, which means I work mainly on the visible side of react native applications.
In the complex system I work everyday with **backend developer** in the project team. Having a good teamwork and cooperation between those both sides can make the progress of work much faster.

I’m sometimes stuck after getting some kind of error from **API** which I don’t fully understand and I can talk to backend developer to help me out in such errors. This way backend developer can understand that he may introduce a small change in the **API** in order to make it work better for **API** consumers.

When you’re working at any company - having a **good relationship **with “the other side” of development is a fundament of your **satisfaction** with your work and making progress for a client. Having an **understanding attitude** towards each other problems, **respecting each other’s workloads** and **time-schedules** makes you and your coworker wanting to work with you again in the future.

This is a **great soft skill** to have.
Most of us software developers work in some kind of company and we’ll always work in teams, whether you workremotely or in the office, good teamwork is always better than trying to brin each other's mojo down.
