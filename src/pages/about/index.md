My name is **Paweł Karniej** and less than 2 years ago I made a promise to myself that I'll become a software developer. I kept my promise and since **January 2018** I am working as a **React Native Developer**. I love every aspect of it and it totally changed my life, that's why I want share my journey from how it all started to  wherever it will take me.

There are quite a few great blogs from programmers out there, but every one which I know was created by CS students and people who has been doing programming for a long time.

I created this blog to encourage people that you don't have to have a CS degree to become a developer and get into software development industry. I didn't need it to get my first job. I didn't need it to get my second, all what mattered was my skills - which I got from hard work and persistence.

I don't have the best salary in the industry yet, but it actually has doubled in my first half of a year in the industry! I make enough living to provide for myself and my family and I am sitting at home, at my desk, working remotely.

If you ever thought about becoming a software developer I want to help you, I was there not so long ago - I started in **November 2016**. No matter how much time you have, how old are you, I am here to share my best tips to achieve **your goal**.

As a digital nomad working remotely from home, I’ll present best ways to organize your day and how to balance it correctly with other activities.

Programming isn’t the first thing that I’ve **learned by myself**, I am a former **self-made beatboxer and music producer**. I took the attitude, best ways in **self-teaching** and tips for constant progress in music and applied to learning new skills as a programmer. I want to **share everything I learned** by myself and help people to change their lives for the better.

I just got into the **software industry** a minute ago and I hope I will be helpful and you'll enjoy following my journey and perspective of exploring this world as a **Selfmade Developer**.
